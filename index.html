            Meet Jeff. He is a cellist, guitarist, web developer, audio engineer, amateur chef, skier,
            runner,
            backpacker, Game of Thrones enthusaist, gardner, fermentationist, and a lover of a new experiences. Jeff's
            interests are about as diverse as they can be. He cannot seem to make up his mind on a consistent plan for
            his day off. There is never a dull moment in this maniacs life. He is either racing down the side of a
            mountain (usually falling off of cliffs) or he might be fully entrenched in practicing cello, attending an
            open jam at a local watering hole, or tackling the complex task of becoming a master computer programmer.
            <br>
            He plans on taking
            his programming skills and working on creative projects with local artists and musicians. He will attempt
            to take his skills with web development and design his owncreative platform for online interactive musical
            engines. He sees computer programming as a key tool in facilitating big idea projects and campaigns.
            <br>
            With all
            of these activities youd think this man must be a shut in, o contrare, he plays hard. He trys to maintain
            on active social life as he sees it vital for developing a balanced lifestyle. </p>
